# Social-Network-API
NoSQL Challenge while using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM

## Background

MongoDB is known for its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data among social networks. The impact of this challenge is to understand how to build and structure the API because the foundation of applications is data.

## Description

NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API creates an API for an interactive social network web application. The users share thoughts, react to others, and friend lists are formed. This challenge focuses on Express.js, a MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM, and JavaScript date library or native JavaScript Date object to formulate timestamps.

## Usage and Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Mongoose ODM
- Node.js
- Insomnia
- GitHub

## Credits

Code Source : applied throughout the entire process of building to our starter code for this interactive web application! Credits are devoted to the UConn Coding Boot Camp Support Staff (Instructional Staff, TA, Tutors) and the program's activities and challenges materials and BootCamp Spot/Canvas and additional resources given throughout the course and outside research utilizing the Google Chrome browser of information relating to examples of JavaScript coding skills/methods and Back End knowledge needed for completion of this challenge. Further information utiliized when building from this functional code received from BootCamp Spot/Canvas.
